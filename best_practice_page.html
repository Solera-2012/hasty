          <h4> Importance of Common Language</h4>
          To better understand the complexities of this issue it is important for parties to deconstruct the language used to describe the topic <b>Sex Trafficked Youth.</b> 
          </center>

            <h4>Sex trafficked</h4>

                   The complicated world of the sex industry has left victims of trafficking in an extremely vulnerable position due to <b>criminalized sex work conflating victims of trafficking</b>. Specifically, trafficked individuals engage in sexual acts in response to threats of removing (or promises of providing) essential items, such as food, shelter, clothes, or money. A common problem arising is in assuming that the youth has voluntarily chosen to participate in the criminal act of prostitution.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Youth</h4>
<p>
              The seemingly simple term complicates when one considers that a child is anyone under the age of 18 and a teenager is anyone between 13-19. The overlap here does not offer a clear procedure for youth transitioning out of these categories. The age of the individual <b>significantly influences their opportunities to receive services</b>.  
</p><p>
            In addition, these youth are difficult to identify. In many cases law enforcement meet youth under custody on unrelated charges. This leads to youth being <b>treated as criminals rather than providing trauma responsive care</b> or other services.

Although common characteristics such as experiencing abuse or neglect may be used to help identify youth at risk of coercion, victims are still difficult to help.

          Many times, they are traumatized, and they are often pursuaded to not press charges, with the intent of not dredging up memories and further traumatizing the victims. 
          </p>
          <p>
          When working with this population it is important to note the interconnection between victims of trafficking, law enforcement, service providers, and the surrounding community.

          Empowering youth to decide whether or not to press charges against traffickers is an ethical dilemma for both the social worker and law enforcement. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Social worker values of client self-determination often conflicts with law enforcement that prioritizes prosecution over the victimâ€™s needs.
